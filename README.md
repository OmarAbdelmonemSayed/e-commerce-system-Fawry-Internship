# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce System

This project simulates a simple console-based e-commerce system written in Java. It models real-world product types, customer behavior, and business rules like product expiry, shipping, and purchase limitations.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Abstract product hierarchy with multiple behaviors:
    - Shipable products (require shipping weight)
    - Expirable products (have expiration dates)
- Cart and customer system for adding and purchasing products
- Custom exceptions for clean error handling
- Shipping service that collects all shippable items
- Console-based checkout summary with subtotal, shipping, and remaining balance
